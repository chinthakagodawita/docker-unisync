{"name":"Docker-unisync","tagline":"Unison-based mounts for docker-machine.","body":"# docker-unisync\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chinthakagodawita/docker-unisync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chinthakagodawita/docker-unisync)\r\n\r\ndocker-unisync mounts a specified directory into your Docker Machine and recursively watches that directory for changes. Changed files are copied across to your Docker Machine using [Unison](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/).\r\n\r\nFiles changed on your Docker Machine are copied back to the source folder as well.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, only Mac OS X is supported due to reliance on the FSEvents API. Once the Go fsnotify library [supports recursive directory watching](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/18), this may be revisited.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Mac OS X (tested on 10.11 El Capitan but should work with 10.9+)\r\n* Unison 2.48.3\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall Unison with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install unison\r\n```\r\n\r\nBinaries for this will be available very soon. For the meantime, install Go 1.5 and install via `go get`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install go\r\ngo get chinthakagodawita/docker-unisync\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nFirst make sure your Docker Machine is running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-machine up mymachine\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `cd` to the directory you want to sync and run `docker-unisync`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /my/sync/dir\r\ndocker-unisync mymachine\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, provide source and destination parameters:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-unisync --source=/my/sync/dir --destination=/dir/on/machine mymachine\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee `docker-unisync --help` for a full list of options.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nAll dependencies are managed via [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) and the [Go 1.5 Vendor Experiment](https://golang.org/s/go15vendor).\r\n\r\nTo build, install `godep`, `cd` to this directory and run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\r\ngodep restore\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Releasing\r\n\r\n1. Increment the version number in the `Makefile`\r\n2. Commit and tag the commit with the same version number with a 'v' prefix (e.g. `v0.0.1`)\r\n3. Push to the `master` branch, Travis will take care of building a releasing a binary.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
